WEBSITE FOR aespa

The intended audience are for those who do not know aespa and want to get to know them better.
The purpose is to help them gain more fans and allow them to reach more international success.
The value that it provides to the users are that they are able to purchase items and as well as 
get to listen to their latest music.
I hope this website would allow more people to know more about them

DESIGN PROCESS
As this website is for aespa themselves, their latest comeback is called 'drama'
it shows an overall red theme, furturistic as usual and a powerful video and song.
I chose the theme to have of the website to be red and black, matching their latest
'drama' theme very well.This way, with this particular styling and design, people would
insantly know who this website is for.I also used their new aespa logo, the one 
that suited the new 'drama' theme.
